## Synopsis

A butler for your RSS needs, especially for sites that cannot be bothered to provide a proper RSS feed or API.

## Motivation

For some Web sites, scrapping their HTML is the only option to get something similar to a useful RSS feed. For others, there's no API for getting the desired information or it requires two or more sites to gather it.
Therefore, a butler to gather interesting data from multiple sources and produce an RSS feed (plus a RESTful API) to manage that information.
